# Buyback and Burn

## Objective

To support the value of DENA, the key token of DeNations, we operate the following monetary policy.

## Monetary Policy

### Buyback

**Buyback Budgets**

- Up to 10% of quarterly Nation Ownership sales (directly sold by DeNations) sold in Ether may be used as a quarterly buyback budget for the next quarter, when it is considered that DENA is underpriced. For instance, if accumulated Ether sales of 2021 1Q (January ~ March) sold by DeNations was 100 Ether, then DeNations may use up to 10 ETH as buyback budget of 2021 2Q (April ~ June)
- 10% of the 1st land sales will be used for DENA buyback and burn.
- 30% of the royalty fee (3.5%) from land’s secondary sales will be used for DENA buyback and burn.

**Buyback Execution Timeline**

Buyback execution may happen at arbitrary times at our discretion without prior notice to prevent abusing activity or arbitrage players. Buyback frequency may be also arbitrary.

### Burn

Platform fees (NFT registration fee, NFT upgrade)that users have paid in terms of DENA will be collected and burned monthly.

### Inflation

A perpetual inflation rate of 1~5% per year will begin after 4 years, ensuring continued participation of users at the expense of passive DENA holders. A proper inflation rate can motivate platform activities, thereby increasing platform value and eventually increasing DENA’s value.

1) 100% of newly minted DENA will be allocated to community reward

2) The default inflation rate is set to 3%

3) Holders of DENA can vote to change the inflation rate from 1% to 5%.(requires ⅔ agreement with at least 4% of circulating DENA participating)
