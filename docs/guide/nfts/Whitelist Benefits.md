# Whitelist Benefits

- ## Early Access

Early Access Whitelists will get the very first access to every round of land minting. These users will be able to preoccupy the rarest lands (level 5 lands). Level 5 lands are extremely limited. 

- ## Regular Whitelist
 
Whitelisted players can access every round of land minting prior to public sale. They will have a chance to mint lands after the Early Access Whitelists.

## How to get Whitelisted

- ## Discord (https://discord.gg/Qvje9kxEGU)
  
DeNations’ users with mint pass already have access to the Early Access Whitelist. However, we also want to give our Discord members a chance to get on the Early Access Whitelist.

<u>Early Access Whitelist for Discord Members:</u>

Reach the highest level you can achieve on the Discord Server. The maximum level you can reach is level 10. Once you reach level 10, you will have access to the private channel, where we will guide you through the Early Access Whitelist. 

<u>How to level up:</u>

Upgrade your level by chatting actively on the server. The maximum level you can reach only by chatting is level 5. Please submit the google form during the application period to level up to higher levels. We will level you up manually, according to your activities of inviting friends and posting your DeNations NFTs (including the Art Chain NFTs).

<u>Guidelines:</u>

1. Upgrade your level by being active on the server
   
   \- You will automatically get XP and level up as you chat in the discord community.
The maximum level that you can achieve only by chatting is level 5

2. Invite Friends
   
   \- We will upgrade you by one level for every 5 friends you invite.

3. Post screenshots of your nations ownership NFTs on ‘show-your-nft’

   \- Make sure to match your opensea account name and Discord ID in the screenshot so that we know it’s you
You can only be upgraded by ONE level, no matter how many NFTs you show.

4. Share DeNations contents such as Nations Ownership NFT, Land NFT, etc. on your social media (Twitter, Youtube, TikTok, Medium, and more) 

   \- Post the screenshot and link on ‘share-on-socialmedia’

```mdx-code-block
<p class="error">*Examples </p>
<p class="error"> 
1) If you reached level 4 by being active on the server, invited 20 friends, and posted a screenshot of your nation ownership NFT, you will be upgraded to level 9 (4+4+1)

<p class="error">
2) If you reached level 5 by being active on the server, invited 25 friends, and shared on your social media, you will be upgraded to level 10 (5+4+1)
</p>
```

3. Check your status
   
   \- Check your level on 'check-level' by using '/level' in the chat

   \- Check your number of invites on 'invite-friends’ by using '/invites' in the chat
   
4. Submit a google form during the application period

<u>Rules:</u>

   \- Members with the highest levels will gain access to a private channel.

   \- Members must submit the google form in order to gain level upgrades for inviting friends and posting NFTs.

   \- Level upgrades for inviting friends, posting NFTs, and sharing on social media will be done manually during the application period.
