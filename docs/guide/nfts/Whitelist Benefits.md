# Whitelist Benefits

- ## Early Access

Early Access Whitelists will get the very first access to every round of land minting. These users will be able to preoccupy the rarest lands (level 5 lands). Level 5 lands are extremely limited.

- ## Regular Whitelist
 
Whitelisted players can access every round of land minting prior to public sale. They will have a chance to mint lands after the Early Access Whitelists.

## How to get Whitelisted

- ## Discord (https://discord.gg/VvfBW98Tbx)
  
Get updates on Discord Whitelist Channel. You can check upcoming whitelist events and guidelines there.

## Land Minting
Land Minting will start at end of May. Check out DeNations land maps and look up which lands you want to mint in the future.
