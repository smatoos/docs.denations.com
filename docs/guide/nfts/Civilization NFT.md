# Civilization NFT (Coming Soon)

## Description

- Each Civilization NFT series is based on real Civilization.
- Each Civilization NFT is unique.
- The combination of the data from the actual civilization, such as Wikipedia search volume, and the resources put in to create NFT series determines the current power of the Civilization NFT.
- The minting volume of the Civilization NFT Series and the properties of each NFT can be controlled by the generator.
- Civilization NFT can be ‘displayed’ on City Block, which eventually increases the power of City Block.
