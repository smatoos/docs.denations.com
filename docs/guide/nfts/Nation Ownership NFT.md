## Usage

### Tax Farming

Register your Nation Ownerships (NFTs) and enjoy tax (yield) farming.

:::tip

The HIGHER DGDPs are registered, the MORE Tax (in DENA) you can receive.  

:::

### Founder Tax

Early buyers will enjoy special Founder Tax.

1. **Definition & Source of Founder Tax:** 

    10% of sales of ownerships per round are compensated to the ownership owners of the previous round. This reward is defined as the Founder Tax.

2. **Founder Tax Distribution:** 

    40% of the Founder Tax (Top 5 Founder Tax) will be allocated to the top 5 registered owners who own the most ownerships at the end of the previous round. 60% of Founder Tax (Normal Founder Tax) will be distributed in proportion to the number of ownerships registered at the end of the previous round. When there is a tie, the owner who registered their last ownership earlier takes the higher rank.

3. **Time of the Measurement:**

    The status of the registered Nation Ownerships is measured when the previous round ends (when the last Nation Ownership of the previous round is sold) and this determines distribution of the founder tax reward for the current round.

4. **Register Nation Ownerships to Qualify:**

    You need to register your Nation Ownerships to qualify to receive Founder Tax. Users who already registered their Nation Ownerships do not need to register twice.

    **[Register Ownerships â†’](https://play.denations.com/market)**

5. **Tax Reward Date:**

    The Founder Tax reward will be paid when the current round ends and new round starts (when the last Nation Ownership of the round is sold).

6. **Exceptions:** 

    DeNations Ownerships & Myanmar Ownerships are excluded. 

- Founder Tax is distributed according to the number of registered nation ownership owned at the end of the previous round.

- 85 new France Ownerships are sold (which excludes resale) during the 3rd round.
- The total sales amount was 100 ETH.
- Founder tax reward for John at round 3 will be 1.39 ETH which includes.
- Normal Founder Tax (0.79 ETH=50 ETH*10%*60%*(50/190)) and Top 5 Founder Tax (0.60 ETH=50 ETH*10%*40%*30%)

### President Compensation

A President receives 20% of national tax and determines the national policy and executes the national budget.
