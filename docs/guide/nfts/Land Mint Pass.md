# Land Mint Pass

## Definition of the LAND

- DeNations' earth is divided by 390,000 LAND Hexagons; each Hexagon has its own coordinates, such as (115, 132), and internal properties.
- DeNations' Citizens can reside in the LAND.
- Various resources will be produced in the LAND.
- LAND will be represented as NFT and will be able to trade in the open markets.
- An initial map will start with 312,000 Level 0 LANDs and 78,000 Level 1 LANDs.

## Ownership of the LAND

- LAND is a personal asset when a player purchases the NFT.
- LAND owners can select a nation that belongs to the LAND.
- LAND owners can develop their land.

## LAND Level: 

- As the collection rate of the resource increases, the development point also increases.
- When the development point reaches the maximum value at its level, the LAND Level will increase.
- When the level of land increases by 1, the level of resource production almost doubles that of the lower level of the land.

## Starting Territory

- Definition: Land that is initially assigned to 195 nations upon DeNations' inception. This land is airdropped to the holders of Nation Ownerships.
- Size (quantity) of the Starting LAND gets larger when the nation's DGDP gets bigger.
- When LAND is connected with Nation Ownership the LAND will join the Nation's territory.
- Once the LAND is joined to one nation's Territory, LAND owners can produce more Resources and Nation Ownership holders can receive more taxes.

## Starting LAND Airdrop

- Starting LAND Mint Pass, an NFT ticket that can be exchanged for Starting LAND of the nation in proportion to the number of snapshot registrations by Nation Ownership is airdropped.
- When the Map is revealed, holders of the Starting LAND Mint Pass can claim the land they want that is within the starting land area.

## Starting LAND 2nd Airdrop

- For the holders of the newly released Nation Ownership NFTs, the snapshot of NFT registration for the 2nd Airdrop will be taken soon.
- For the 2nd airdrop participants, LAND airdrop proportion will be 50% less than the 1st LAND airdrop proportion.
