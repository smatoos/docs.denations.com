## Land Territory

- Land territory is the land belonging to a certain nation.
- Once minted land becomes a part of a nation’s territory, the land will produce more resources with the help of national infrastructure. Also, the nation owner will earn more taxes when citizens farm more resources within the land territory.
- Minted land is not connected to any nations in the beginning, but holders of nation ownership NFT will be able to connect their nations to minted lands. Only holders of nation ownership NFT are eligible for connecting lands with nations.
- Holders of nation ownership NFT will be able to claim rights of land connectivity depending on D-GDP of nations. The Higher D-GDP the user has, the more land will be available to connect to the nation.
- **Potential nation of land territory**: Certain lands are only available to connect designated nations. This will be temporary, and over time, the restriction will be removed. For example, certain lands in the USA will only be able to connect to USA ownership NFT. However, the restriction of connecting lands with designated nations will be removed in the future. 
- **Expansion and invasion of land territory**: Connecting a nation with any lands and making it land territory will be unavailable in the beginning. A holder of nation ownership NFT would have to check the potential nation of the land prior to connecting it. For example, the holder of Mexico ownership NFT will not be able to connect or invade certain lands that are designated as USA territory. However, expanding the land territories is allowed as long as the potential nation of the lands matches nation ownership NFT.

## Land State

- Multiple land territories become a state if it's held by an individual person (i.e. same ethereum address).
- Every holder of nation ownership NFT can have a land state once they connect their nations to minted lands. 
- The name of the state is customizable, but it's not allowed to have the same name as other players.
