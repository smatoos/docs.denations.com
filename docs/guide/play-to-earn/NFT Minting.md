## Finance platform

[Decentralized Nations | DENA APP](https://finance.denations.com/#/nft)

![Untitled](./assets/nft-minting/Untitled.png)

## Why introducing NFT Minting with DENA

- To provide more usage cases and value for **[DENA token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentralized-nations/)**
- To decrease supply & increase demand for DENA by providing users motivation to lock up DENA

## Benefits for participants

- Get ownership NFTs by just depositing DENA (without paying).
- Invest in DENA’s value appreciation.
- Get exclusive nations that can be only minted with DNFT.
- Since a fixed amount of DNFT is distributed per week (500 DNFT per week), the early participants can accumulate more DNFTs.

## About DNFT Farm

### 500 DNFT per Week

A total of 500 DNFT (DeNations Nation Founding Token) will be distributed equally over the week in proportion to the amount of DENA staked. The weekly rate may be adjusted to a higher number.

### 1 DNFT =~ 1 DGDP

With earned 100 DNFT, you may exchange approximately 100 DGDP worth of Nations Ownership. However, there might be exceptions.

### 100 DNFT per 1 DeNation Ownership

50 [DeNations Ownership](https://www.notion.so/96eaf67f8e1b8bc494d3863863c1f8ed) NFTs will be allocated for the start, priced at 100 DNFT per 1 [DeNations Ownership](https://www.notion.so/96eaf67f8e1b8bc494d3863863c1f8ed). We may add more exotic Nation Ownerships buyable /exclusively buyable with DNFT.
