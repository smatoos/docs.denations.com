# Art Farming(Farm with NFT)

## About Art Farming

When owners register DeNations Art NFTs in the National Art Museum, they will receive a token reward (in DENA) depending on the Art Index and the registration time.

For the first year of DeNations (until 2021 Dec 16), **Minimum of 500 DENA/week** (DeNation Fund may add more to the Art Farm) will be allocated to Art Farming. People will share the above amount in proportion to the registered Art Index & registration duration. Expected APR (Annual Percent Rate) can be calculated as below, assuming **1 Art Index = 1 USD value**.
