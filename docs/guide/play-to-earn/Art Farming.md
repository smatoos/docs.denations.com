# Art Farming(Farm with NFT)

## About Art Farming

When owners register DeNations Art NFTs in the National Art Museum, they will receive a token reward (in DENA) depending on the Art Index and the registration time.

Until 2022 Dec 16,Â **Minimum of 230.8 DENA/week** will be allocated to Art Farming. People will share the above amount in proportion to the registered Art Index & registration duration. 

- The earlier you register and the higher the DENA price, the more yield from Art Farming you can get.
- The participant will share the distributed DENA in proportion to their registered Art Index.
- Owners can register Art NFTs in Art Farming Beta (temporary replacement of the National Museum.)
- Payout will happen every two weeks within 7 days after settlement.
