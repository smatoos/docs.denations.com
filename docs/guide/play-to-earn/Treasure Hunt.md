## Description

- Every land has hidden treasures during the ‘Treasure Hunt’ land minting round. Only the landowner who mint the land can open the treasure box.
- The landowner will have a choice of 3 treasure boxes with different treasures inside. The treasure is sent directly to the landowner’s wallet once opened.

## Treasures

- The 1st treasure is Wrapped Ether (WETH). The treasure can be up to 0.1 WETH. The total number of WETH for treasures will be different depending on the minting round.
- When the treasure hunt starts, the map will be updated with the list of top ranked hidden treasures and the status of treasure hunting.
- The distribution of treasures among the lands is completely random. Therefore, you will have a chance to find a high-valued treasure in a low-level land.
