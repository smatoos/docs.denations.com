# Whitelist Benefits

## Early Access Whitelist

Early Access Whitelists will get the very first access to every round of land minting. These users will be able to preoccupy the rarest lands (level 5 lands). Level 5 lands are extremely limited.

## General Whitelist

Whitelisted players can access every round of land minting prior to public sale. They will have a chance to mint lands after the Early Access Whitelists.

## How to get Whitelisted

## Discord

```mdx-code-block
import {ExternalLinkCard} from '@site/src/components/Link/Card'

<ExternalLinkCard title="Join Discord" to="https://discord.gg/VvfBW98Tbx" style={{margin: '1rem 0'}}/>
```

Get updates on Discord Whitelist Channel. You can check upcoming whitelist events and guidelines there.
