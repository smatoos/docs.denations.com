### Block Reward

20% of DeNations Fund generated from current block NFT sales is distributed to the NFT arts owners of previous blocks. The Block Reward is designed to give incentives to two parties below.

1. Early NFT art collector: The collector who buys NFTs in the block will enjoy continuous Block Rewards for every block connected after the block.
2. DeNations Art Committee: In order to make the Art NFT of the previous blocks more valuable, the committee (including artists from the previous block) needs to recruit talented NFT artists and assign an optimal Art Index which will maximize next block sales.

Only Block Rewards of more than 10 USD are paid, and blockchain fees can be deducted from rewards upon transmission.
