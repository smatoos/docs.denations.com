### DGDP

```mdx-code-block
import {ExternalLinkCard} from '@site/src/components/Link/Card'

<ExternalLinkCard title="Calculation of DGDP" to="https://www.notion.so/Calculation-of-DGDP-b4316769b5874861b0191a6110763999" style={{margin: '1rem 0'}}/>
``` 

### Register

You have to register NFT nation ownership cards in order to enjoy the Founder Tax and Tax Farming. You can determine how many cards you want to register. When they are registered, the weekly tax rate will be automatically calculated based on the stated DGDP. When you are the one who registered the most, then you become the president of the nation. 

:::tip

***Higher DGDPs mean a higher weekly tax rate you can earn.***

:::

:::tip

*President has special privileges and will be compensated a bit more than the other owners.*

:::

:::caution NOTE

*You are unable to unregister the cards once you registered, but when you sell or transfer your Ownership NFT to other accounts, they will be automatically unregistered.*

::: 

### Boost

There are several ways to increase the DGDP of your nation. One powerful tool to increase the DGDP is using DN cards. Successfully registered nation ownership cards can be “boosted” by the DN cards. Boosting can make your national DGDP even higher, increasing your weekly tax rate accordingly.

:::caution NOTE

*You are able to detach the DN cards which were used to boost your nations, but when you sell or transfer your DN cards to others, they will be automatically detached from the order of the smallest DGDP.*

:::

:::info INFORMATION

*Whenever you attach Nation Ownership cards or DN cards, DENA is necessary.*

:::

:::warning DENA BURN POLICY

*DENA used during registration will be burned.*
