# Register Ownership (NFT)

## Purpose

Why encourage "Register Ownership"?

- **Tax Farming**: similar DeFi concept to the liquidity mining or **yield farming** as you register your NFTs (among Nation, DN, and Art) and get Tax (in DENA) as a reward.

- **Founder Tax**: **10% of sales** of ownerships per round are **compensated** to the Ownership owners of the previous round. This reward is defined as the Founder Tax.
