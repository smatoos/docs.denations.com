# Register Ownership (NFT)

## Purpose

### Why encourage "Register Ownership"?

- **Tax Farming**: similar DeFi concept to the liquidity mining or yield farming as you register your NFTs (among Nation, DN, and Art) and get Tax (in DENA) as a reward.

- **Founder Tax**: 10% of sales of ownerships per week is accumulated and distributed to the players who registered at the beginning of the week. This reward is defined as the Founder Tax.
