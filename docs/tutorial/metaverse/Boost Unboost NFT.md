## How to

`Step 4.` Click '-' sign when you want to unboost DN from the currently attached Nation NFT.

TIP
DENA is necessary when boosting while DENA is NOT necessary when unboosting.

NOTE
You are able to detach the DN cards which were used to boost your nations, but when you sell or transfer your DN cards to others, they will be automatically detached from the order of the smallest DGDP.
