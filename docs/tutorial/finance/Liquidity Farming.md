DENA token is traded in Uniswap, two of leading Decentralized Exchange (DEX) services. Users are free to add liquidity of DENA and earn DENA plus trading fee.
First of all, you need a Ethereum wallet that is compatible with ERC20 to use DEX, such as Uniswap.

**[Get Metamask Ethereum Wallet](https://metamask.io/download.html)** if you don’t have it.

### Uniswap(Text Tutorial)

In Uniswap, you can add liquidity for DENA-ETH pairs. To do this you need a wallet that owns DENA and ETH. If you do not have DENA, **[trade ETH/DAI for DENA](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x15F0EEDF9Ce24fc4b6826E590A8292CE5524a1DA&use=V2).**

`Step 1.` Go to the link below.
